        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Amon McAllister. I attended Iowa State University and got my undergraduate degree in software engineering.
            I am currently pursuing a masters in Industrial Agricultural Technology and a Co-major in Human Computer Interaction.
            I have worked for a lab on the ISU campus by the name VirtuTrace for almost 3 years now and as such have a lot of experience with Virtual Reality, Unity, and training simulations.

                <p>An all-inclusive training solution for vehicle inspections made for the Iowa Department of Transportation that I served as a developer on.</p>
                <p>With MVE-VR, put your trainees through a level VI vehicle inspection and immediately conduct a segmented After Action Review. This review breaks down every portion of the vehicle inspection and allows you and your trainee to view an interactive simulation playback from different camera angles of what the trainee saw whilst in Virtual Reality.</p>
                <h4>In this full scale vehicle inspection simulator trainees can:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interact with the driver and review their documents</li>
                    <li>Check lights and vehicle functions</li>
                    <li>Gather radiation readings of shipments</li>
                    <li>Inspect items and view their statuses</li>
                    <li>Go inside the cab and inspect instruments</li>
                    <li>Get under the hood and view critical parts</li>
                    <li>Take pictures and audio recordings of your findings</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Before and after an inspection Instructors are able to:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Author their own vehicle damage generator for a more direct inspection</li>
                    <li>Put trainees in a completely randomized or a previously authored inspection</li>
                    <li>Spectate an inspection that is being conducted on another computer</li>
                    <li>Add users that need to conduct inspections</li>
                    <li>Review past inspections with a detailed segmented After Action Review</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>I personally developed:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many of the inspection elements and grabbables</li>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Tooltips that pop up when physically interacting with elements</li>
                        <li>Audio recording that can be saved and viewed later</li>
